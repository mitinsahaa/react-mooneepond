        "title": "I've bought several things from this amazing family owned gem! I do not know how they manage to have such great prices but am so grateful as I am a homebody and love, without breaking the bank, making my home my castle and sanctuary. Visiting MP Antiques is always a pleasure, though I have to be careful as never have I gone without seeing things I want! They also do restoration and their service is first rate, everyone who works at MP Antiques is just lovely to deal with. Do yourself a huge favour, save your many, don't bother with the over-priced stores on the 'other' side of town, go to Moonee Ponds Antiques.",
